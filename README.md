# Reibun: Japanese Sample Sentences _in Context_
A search engine for finding high quality native Japanese articles published on
the web demonstrating in-context usage for any bit of Japanese language of
interest.

Can be used to search for native in-context usage of Japanese words,
set phrases, sayings, idioms, and more!

## Motivation

After years of Japanese study, I've found that the most important thing for me
to understanding new bits of Japanese language is to see those bits of language
used by natives in as much context as possible. 

There are multiple large collections of Japanese sample sentences out there
such as [the Tatoeba Project][1], [Weblio][2], and [Yourei][3] that can help
with this, but these collections all tend to have the same problem: They lack
the vital _context_ around the sample sentence.

An isolated sample sentence might be great to show grammatically how a bit of
language is used, but without more context, it's difficult to get a natural
feel for the greater context of _when_ and _where_ natives use that bit of
language which is paramount to getting a native understanding of that bit of
language.

## Reibun Priorities

Reibun attempts to solve this issue of context by linking users to high quality
native Japanese articles published on the web that demonstrate usage of a bit
of lanugage searched for.

When deciding which articles to return for a search, in addition to article
relevance to the searched bit of language, Reibun has the following additional
priorities:

* _Accompanying videos and pictures are awesome_
Accompanying videos or pictures in articles serve to add even more context to
aid in learning the searched bit of language. Videos esspecially are given high
prioriy.

* _The more recent the article, the better_
Articles published more recently tend to be about more currently relevent
topics in the world which make for more memorable context than old articles
about no longer relevant topics.

* _Not too short, not too long_
Articles that are only a couple hundred characters tend to be too short to give
much context, but articles that are many thousands of characters take too much
time to read to understand the context, so articles of moderate length
(~1000-1500 characters) are prioritized.
