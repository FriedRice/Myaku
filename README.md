# Myaku: Learning Japanese _from Context_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FriedRice/Myaku.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FriedRice/Myaku)

A search engine for finding native Japanese articles on the web that
demonstrate in-context usage for any bit of Japanese language.

## What can Myaku do?

Searching for any bit of Japanese language on Myaku will return links to
articles that demonstrate _when_ and _where_ Japanese people use that bit of
language.

These articles can then be read to build a deeper and more natural
understanding for how that bit of language is used in Japanese than can be
gained from looking at definitions or sample sentences alone.

Notably, beyond just individual words, Myaku can also be used to search for
articles demonstrating usage of more complex bits of language such as set
phrases, sayings, idioms, and more!


## Why not just use a normal web search engine like Google?

Myaku is a search engine completely built around finding native Japanese
articles that are the best for learning when and where a searched bit of
Japanese language is used by natives.

This fundamentally differs from normal web search engines such as Google which
are built around finding web pages that are the most relevant to the given
search terms. When searching for bits of Japanese language, this often leads to
search results full of just meta discussion about that bit of Japanese
language.

For example, if you search for a single Japanese word such as 千載一遇 in
Google, the top results are all either dictionary, thesaurus, or encyclopedia
entries for that word, forum posts asking questions about that word, or
articles with meta discussion about the word. Although these results are useful
to gain a technical understanding of the word, they are very poor for getting a
natural feel for when and where natives use that word.

In contrast, when the same word is searched in Myaku, it gives results such as
NHK news articles or Japanese blog posts that aren't specifically about the
word, but made use of the word to convey the message of the article. Although
these articles give no technical details about the word, they are clear
examples of when and where natives use the word.

More than reading technical details about the word given by Google, reading
these articles gives a natural feel for how the word is actually used in
Japanese.
